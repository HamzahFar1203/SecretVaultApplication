WHEN YOU GO TO THE WEBSITE, take a few moments to read what the website has to say before you enter the password and move onto the next screen, it's part of the experience.

The purpose of this web app is quite simple, to provide the user with a good note-taking experience. I want to create a note-taking application with a UI that is convenient, easily understandable, and yet, very powerful.
