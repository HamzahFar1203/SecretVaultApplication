# Secret Vault Web App

PURPOSE:
The purpose of this web app is quite simple, to provide the user with a good note-taking experience. I want to create a note-taking application with a UI that is convenient, easily understandable, and yet, very powerful.

**Things To Know:**
1. This web app is still in early development, which means that a LOT of things are not fully developed.
2. ON THE LANDING PAGE, the text cycles through a few pre-made strings, for the full experience, I would recommend you spend a few moments reading it.

**Major Changes:**
1. 5/17/2023 - Website added to Github.
2. 5/18/2023 - Major UI Changes, systemm.js replaced, systeml.css replaced, system.html added.
